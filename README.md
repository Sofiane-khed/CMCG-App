# CMCG: A Co-attention Mechanism into a Combined GNN-based Model for Detecting Fake News
This repository contains official implementation code of paper **A Co-attention Mechanism into a Combined GNN-Based Model for Fake News Detection** [(link)](...).

## Overview

The main objective of this work is to use Co-attention Mechanism into a Combined GNN based model (CMCG) for capturing the relationship between user profiles features and user preferences in order to detect fake news, and  examine the influence of various social media features on fake news detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- To use this model, you need to install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).
- Dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Sofiane-khd/CMCG-App.git
  cd CMCG
  # Install library
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
